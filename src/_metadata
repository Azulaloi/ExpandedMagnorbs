  "description" : "An expanded series of magnorbs. \n\nThe makeshift set is known by default and craftable at the tier 2 anvil. Currently, all magnorbs have the same shield ability, but in the future I plan to replace these with thematic abilities. \n\nFeel free to leave feedback regarding damage, progression and abilities, or ideas for new sets of magnorbs. Please report any bugs you find. I apologize for the five duplicate recipes in the anvil, I will try and find a workaround for that as soon as possible. \n\nPlease note that this mod replaces the functionality of my previous mod (High-Velocity Magnorbs) but is technically compatible. I would recommend only one or the other (depending on how much magnorb related content you desire).",
